# function: build a full-size CNN and train it (might need helper func), save the best result.
# function: using a specified (input) full-cnn model, build a sklearn pipeline for scnn-rf
# function: using a specified (input) full-cnn model, build a sklearn pipeline for scnn-svm

    # will likely run all three of the build functions (might as well). 3 new models will be added to models directory.
